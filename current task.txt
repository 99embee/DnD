TO DO: 

#added text fields in the GUI. starting adding keywords that call functions. 

#I could use an ai to extract the keywords from a user's input. 
then feed it into a text generating ai model to describe the actions. 


# finish redesining the character creation window. 
The notebook style is the uniform style from now on. 


# add buttons to class, subclass, race, subrace, ... in the character sheet. 
# They should open a top level window. 



# eventually create the item class with swords, armour, potions etc. 
# on character creation when selecting starting equipment - open a 'shop' that references starting items

# make ability modifiers actually do something
# create saving throws
# create ability throws ( str, dex, ,...)
# Create the proficencies and have the ability modifiers affect those proficencies
