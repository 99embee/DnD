TO DO: 


# finish redesining the character creation window. 
The notebook style is the uniform style from now on. 


# add buttons to class, subclass, race, subrace, ... in the character sheet. 
# They should open a top level window. 

# display the class, race, subrace details in character creation. - done

# display the class table in one tab of a notebook format, another tab would be the starting details. - done 

-------------------
------------
-----
# sorcerer, monk, fighter and paladin class table doesnt load. 
# warlock spells are wrong - @filter
-----
------------
warlock index issue. - might have to scrap sorcerer fix. index was used if there was multiple rows. 
but for warlock the index will always be 0 (there is 1 'rows') so the data is always inserted into pos 0+1.
this causes the list to be ordered incorrectly. 
-------------------

# eventually create the item class with swords, armour, potions etc. 
# on character creation when selecting starting equipment - open a 'shop' that references starting items

# make ability modifiers actually do something
# create saving throws
# create ability throws ( str, dex, ,...)
# Create the proficencies and have the ability modifiers affect those proficencies
